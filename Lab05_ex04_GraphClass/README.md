Lab05 - ex04 - Graph class

Define a Graph class for graphs represented by adjacency lists, as a class derived from the Vector class. 

The adjacency lists are also vectors (Vector objects). The graph nodes are numbered starting from 1. 

Define a constructor that takes the number of nodes in the graph as an argument.

Methods:

\* size: Returns the number of nodes in the graph.

\* addArc: Adds an edge/arc to the graph.

\* isArc: Checks if an edge exists between two given nodes.

\* toString: Returns a list of all edges in the graph.

Write a program to create a graph by successively adding edges (based on pairs of numbers provided in the program), display the edges, and display the in-degree and out-degree for each node (the number of edges coming into and going out of the node).
