Lab05 - ex03 - IntSet class

Define a class named IntSet for a set of integers, featuring the methods add, remove, contains, and toString. 

These methods should call corresponding methods from the BitSet class (which represents a vector of bits; thus, bit i is true if i belongs to the set). 

The IntSet class contains a variable of type BitSet and calls methods of the BitSet class.

Methods from the BitSet class:

&nbsp;- boolean get(int bitIndex): Returns true or false depending on whether the bit at bitIndex is set.

&nbsp;- void set(int bitIndex, boolean value): Sets the bit at bitIndex to the specified value.
