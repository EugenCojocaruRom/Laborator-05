# Laborator-05

This repository contains my work for PAOO Lab 5, where I learned about inheritance, method overloading, dynamic binding (polymorphism) and access modifiers.

I used IntelliJ IDEA to work on a series of exercises with regard to creating and using inheritance, polymorphism, method overloading and overriding, and access modifiers.
