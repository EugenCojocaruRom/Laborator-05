Lab05 - ex02 - SortedVector class

Define a class SortedVector derived from class Vector for sorted vectors of objects, with the following redefined methods:

&nbsp;- addElement(Object): adds an element at the end of the vector and then sorts it

&nbsp;- insertElementAt(Object, int): adds at a given position and re-sorts

Write a program for operations with a sorted vector of strings: successive additions of elements (Integer objects) with display after each modification.
