Lab05 - ex01 - SetAsVector Class - Composition

Define a class SetAsVector for a set of objects implemented as an unordered vector with distinct elements, in two variants:

 - Class SetAsVector derived from class Vector (from package java.util)

 - Class SetAsVector contains an object of type Vector

Methods from class Vector that will be implemented in class SetAsVector:

 - boolean add(Object) - adds an element

 - boolean remove(Object) - removes an element

 - boolean contains(Object) - checks if element exists

 - String toString() - string representation

Create a set of strings through successive additions, remove some elements, and display after each operation, using the SetAsVector class.



\*\* NOTE: This covers the first variant, where class SetAsVector contains an object of type Vector (composition -> HAS-A)
